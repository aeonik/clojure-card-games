# clojure-card-games

Collection of simple command-line card games written in Clojure. Currently it is a work in progress. 

I am starting with a two deck variant of Euchre named Karbosh. This game is similar to Indiana Double Deck Bid Euchre, but is played with 6 people instead of 4. See more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_Euchre
